Publishing my progress in x86_64 assembly

I've noticed as I work on learning assembly language that there isn't a lot of *heavily* commented assembly programs out there, that don't assume the reader knows the basics. Even books that are ostensibly geared toward teaching people the basics of assembly language often throw large chunks of code at the reader early on with many unexplained instructions, which is hella frustrating for a newbie who's sitting there with a book that on its cover says it's written as an "introduction" to assembly, which shamelessly piles UNINTRODUCED concepts onto their head and expects the reader to just go look elsewhere (yo authors, that's what the INTRODUCTION is supposed to show the reader) to figure them out or just continue reading gibberish. My process of learning assembly language consisted of successive but not successful attempts to read books about it, reading until I inevitably got lost, then putting the book down and starting another one, reading til the author decided to jump too fast, and starting the process over with the next book. It sure seems like it should be possible to write a book like the excellent "Programming in C" by Stephen G. Kochan which teaches the reader in bitesize chunks about one facet of the language, and then the next, without using *any* concepts which haven't yet been introduced. After a lot of sweat and frustration I finally had a breakthrough where assembly started actually making sense to me, and decided to start publishing assembly code I write it, while assiduously commenting so that it might be of use to people who are just starting out like I was earlier this year. This repository will be a series of programs that do things like print numbers to the screen, create, delete, or copy files, and whatever else I happen to write. I consider myself an advanced beginner, so all these programs come with the caveat that they probably shouldn't be used in programs involving cybersecurity or sensitive information, but anyone writing that kind of program hopefully knows that anyway. :)
